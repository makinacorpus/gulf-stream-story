## Mapbox GL Leaflet

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mapbox/mapbox-gl-leaflet.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mapbox/mapbox-gl-leaflet)

This is a binding from [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to the familiar
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) API.

The leaflet-master branch is compatible with the latest leaflet releases (1.x), see https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-leaflet/tree/leaflet-master
